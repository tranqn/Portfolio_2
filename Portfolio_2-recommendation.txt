## Part 2: Recommended Fixes

### Design Specification

**Responsive Layouts**
- Mobile: <768px (single column, hamburger menu)
- Tablet: 768-1023px (adjusted spacing)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (full two-column layout)
- Max content width: 1440px

**Design System**
- Define color palette with CSS variables
- Specify typography scale (font sizes, weights, line heights)
- Document spacing system (4px/8px grid)

**Interaction States**
- Define: normal, hover, focus, active, disabled for all interactive elements
- Include loading states for buttons

**Accessibility**
- WCAG AA color contrast minimum
- Visible focus outlines
- Screen reader considerations

### Requirements Document

**Animation Rules**
- Hover transitions: 200-300ms
- Scroll animations: 300-500ms
- Easing: ease-out for entries, ease-in-out for toggles

**i18n Approach**
- Use ngx-translate library
- Store translations in JSON (de.json, en.json)
- Persist language preference in localStorage

**Performance Targets**
- Lighthouse Performance: >90
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s

**Testing Requirements**
- Unit test coverage: minimum 70%
- E2E tests for contact form and navigation
- Accessibility audit with axe-core

**Error Handling**
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry logic for failed form submissions
- Form data persistence to prevent data loss

## Part 3: Professional Advice

### Architecture & Scalability

1. **Use standalone components**
   Angular 17+ favors standalone components over NgModules. Simplifies architecture and improves tree-shaking.

2. **Signal-based state management**
   Use Angular Signals for reactive UI state. Reserve RxJS for async operations like HTTP calls.

3. **Environment configuration**
   Set up environment.ts files early for API endpoints and feature flags.

### Development Workflow

4. **ESLint + Prettier**
   Configure from the start with coding standards (camelCase, max line length) to automate style enforcement.

5. **Husky + lint-staged**
   Add pre-commit hooks to run linting and formatting automatically.

6. **Commit strategy**
   Make small, focused commits. Easier to review, revert, and understand history.

### Performance

7. **Modern image formats**
   Use WebP/AVIF (30-50% smaller than JPEG/PNG). Provide fallbacks for older browsers.

8. **Preload critical assets**
   Add `<link rel="preload">` for hero background image and fonts to improve LCP.

9. **Font loading strategy**
   Use `font-display: swap` and subset fonts to only needed characters.

### Contact Form

10. **Rate limiting**
    Implement client-side throttling (disable button for 30s after submit) to prevent spam.

11. **Honeypot field**
    Add a hidden field that bots fill but humans don't. Simple spam protection without CAPTCHA.

### SEO & Social

12. **Meta tags**
    Set up title, description, and OpenGraph tags early. Include canonical URLs.

13. **Sitemap.xml**
    Generate automatically during build for better search engine indexing.

### Security

14. **Content Security Policy**
    Configure CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks.

15. **Input sanitization**
    Sanitize all form inputs on both client and server side.

### Testing Strategy

16. **Prioritize contact form tests**
    This is the only feature with backend integration. Cover edge cases thoroughly.

17. **Visual regression testing**
    Consider Percy or Chromatic for catching unintended UI changes in responsive layouts.
